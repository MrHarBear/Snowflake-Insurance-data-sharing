## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Git Integration Fails
```sql
-- Fallback: Manual data loading
-- Upload CSV files to internal stage manually
PUT file://CLAIMS_DATA.csv @INSURANCE_CSV_STAGE;
PUT file://CUSTOMER_DATA.csv @INSURANCE_CSV_STAGE;
```

#### Dynamic Table Refresh Delays
```sql
-- Manual refresh if needed
ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE ANALYTICS.RISK_LEVEL_MATRIX REFRESH;
```

#### Cross-Account Sharing Issues
```sql
-- Simulate with same-account roles
-- Use MOUNTAINPEAK_ANALYST as "external" user proxy
```

#### Performance Issues
```sql
-- Add LIMIT clauses to reduce result sets
-- Ensure warehouse is properly sized (XSMALL sufficient)
```
