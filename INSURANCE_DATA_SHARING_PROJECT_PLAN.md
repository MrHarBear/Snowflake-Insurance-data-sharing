## üõ°Ô∏è GOVERNANCE POLICIES SPECIFICATION

### 1. Dynamic Masking Policy (Single Policy)
**Purpose**: Protect claim amount sensitivity while maintaining analytical value
```sql
MASK_CLAIM_AMOUNT Implementation:
- ACCOUNTADMIN: $67,432 (full amount)
- ANALYST: $67,432 (full amount - internal user)  
- External Account: $60,000 (floored to nearest $10,000)
```

### 2. Row Access Policy (Single Policy)
**Purpose**: Geographic territory restrictions for broker partners
```sql
ALPINE_BROKER_ACCESS Implementation:
- Alpine Risk Brokers: Only customers from Colorado, Utah, Wyoming
- Internal roles: All customer locations
- Other accounts: All customer locations
```

### 3. Aggregation Policy (Single Policy)
**Purpose**: Statistical privacy protection through minimum group sizes
```sql
MIN_GROUP_POLICY Implementation:
- External accounts: Minimum 20 records per query result
- Internal roles: No aggregation restrictions
- Prevents individual record identification
```

### 4. Projection Policy (Single Policy)
**Purpose**: Hide most sensitive column from external selection
```sql
HIDE_FRAUD_INDICATOR Implementation:
- External accounts: FRAUD_REPORTED column hidden from SELECT
- Internal roles: Full column access
- Can still filter by column, cannot see values
```

---

## üìà DYNAMIC TABLE IMPLEMENTATION

### Risk Level Matrix (Single Dynamic Table)
**Purpose**: Automated risk scoring for customer portfolio analysis

#### Input Data
- Joined customer and claims data
- Customer demographics (age, education, occupation)
- Policy details (premium, deductible)
- Claims history (amount, type, frequency)

#### Risk Scoring Logic
```sql
RISK_LEVEL Calculation:
- HIGH: Age < 25 OR Claim Amount > $75,000 OR Fraud Reported = true
- MEDIUM: Age 25-45 AND Claim Amount $25,000-$75,000  
- LOW: Age > 45 AND Claim Amount < $25,000 AND No Fraud

RISK_SCORE Calculation (0-100):
- Age factor: < 25 = +30 points
- Claim amount factor: > $50,000 = +40 points  
- Fraud factor: Fraud reported = +30 points
- Occupation factor: High-risk jobs = +20 points
```

#### Output Schema
- All customer and claims fields
- RISK_LEVEL (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- RISK_SCORE (0-100 numeric)
- RISK_FACTORS (JSON array of contributing factors)
- REFRESH_TIMESTAMP

#### Refresh Strategy
- **Frequency**: Every 4 hours
- **Trigger**: Automatic based on underlying data changes
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time broker queries

## üé≠ PRESENTATION NARRATIVE & KEY MESSAGES

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"Today I'll show you how MountainPeak Insurance built their risk analytics on Snowflake, shared valuable insights with broker partners, and then intelligently protected their sensitive data - all without disrupting the business value."*

### Risk Analytics Value Proposition (3 minutes)
*"Watch as we join customer and claims data, then automatically calculate risk levels using Dynamic Tables. This risk matrix updates every 4 hours, giving us real-time insights into our portfolio."*

### Data Sharing Business Case (2 minutes)  
*"Now Alpine Risk Brokers gets immediate access to this risk intelligence. They can analyze their book of business risk distribution and make better underwriting decisions."*

### Progressive Governance Narrative (4 minutes per policy)
*"But we need to protect sensitive data. Watch as we progressively add governance controls without breaking the broker's access:"*

1. **Dynamic Masking**: *"Claim amounts are now protected but still useful for analysis"*
2. **Row Access**: *"Brokers only see customers in their territory"*
3. **Aggregation**: *"Privacy is enforced through minimum group sizes"*  
4. **Projection**: *"Fraud indicators are hidden from external partners"*

### Closing Impact (1 minute)
*"The broker still gets valuable risk insights for better business decisions, but MountainPeak's sensitive data is fully protected. Notice how our internal ANALYST role has different access than external accounts - this gives us flexible governance for internal users too."*
